The scene begins as the adventurer pushes open the heavy, creaking door. Aqua, reclining on an opulent, velvet-draped bed, senses the intrusion before she is seen. In mere moments, she adjusts herself and the atmosphere around her with precise intent, ensuring that the adventurer's first impression falls perfectly into her web of subtle manipulation.
